NOTICE: PLEASE KEEP THIS CHANGELOG CLEAN. CONSIDER THIS A README.

v0.02 - 05/21/2017 - Made clipName in delayAnim optional.

v0.01 - 05/21/2017 - First Commit. CBUG is a replacement for Debug.Log that allows for seeing debug logs on-screen post-editor. Tools is a script for simple and common functions. Please 
feel free to update it, but make your own fork first. Anything I find myself using more than once will likely be added to this, but anything added to this MUST be cleaned up and commented.
